### Structure of the Site
This single-page website is designed to quickly educate visitors about the Dreamcatcher Balloon and the Washington nonprofit's ADA-focused mission statement. To serve this dual purpose of awareness and customer education, we have created a one-page vertical scroll-through webpage with information about the Captain, the balloon and the team, concluding in a subscriptionForm that is intended to foster a sense of community for donors, volunteers, and participants.

At any time, the viewer can return to the top of the page by clicking the logo in the top left of the screen, on the navBar. The user can also click the "Subscribe" button on the right side of the navBar to be quickly pushed to the contactForm. Because the navBar follows the user down the page, it is very easy and quick to navigate to the varying sections of the site.

The website features YouTube videos explaining the brand, and a press / blog section aimed at fostering community and customer engagement.
